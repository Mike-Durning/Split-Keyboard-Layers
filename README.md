# Split-Keyboard-Layers
kyria split kb from https://splitkb.com/products/kyria-rev3

[Kyria? What is this?](https://docs.splitkb.com/product-guides/aurora-series/build-guide/what-is-what)

## Putting it Together
1. Soldering for the first time
2. 48 Gateron Ink V2 Black Silent Switches + PBT Caps & 2 tactile encoder switches + N/A Encoder knob (Yet to buy encoder knob... still deciding)
3. Learning a whole new KB Layout - [Cool KB Layout statistics](https://cyanophage.github.io/#handsdown-promethium)
4. Programmable Backlight & Underglow All hand soldered
5. 2 OLED screens (1 for each KB side) - shows layers/wpm/ect
6. Smaller pieces/screws/tinted glass/case + puck (puck for future tenting)/ect

## Benefits of Split KB - Why it might be worth changing layouts - WASD is inefficient in comparison to latest layout research

| Acronym           | Meaning                           | Impact on Typing                                                                                                                            | Impact Type | Example                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alt-fingering** | **Alternate Finger Usage**        | Pressing a key with a different finger than traditional touch typing, optimizing finger movement.                                           | +           | Typing 'g' with index finger instead of middle finger.      |
| **Alternation**   | **Hand Alternation**              | Typing a key with the opposite hand from the last key pressed, balancing workload between hands and improving typing speed.                 | +           | Typing 'T' with right hand after typing 'H' with left hand. |
| **Roll**          | **Roll**                          | Typing two or more keys sequentially with the same hand, moving in the same "direction", which increases typing speed and is comfortable.   | +           | Typing 'sdf' with left hand fingers.                        |
| **Hand Balance**  | **Hand Balance**                  | Indicates the percentage split of typing workload between the left and right hands, preventing fatigue and improving typing efficiency.     | +           | 60% left hand, 40% right hand typing distribution.          |
| **Pinky off**     | **Pinky Finger Usage**            | Reducing strain on the weaker pinky finger by minimizing its usage during typing.                                                           | +           | Avoiding using the pinky for frequent key presses.          |
| **SFB**           | **Same Finger Bigram**            | Pressing two keys with the same finger in conjunction, which can lead to finger fatigue.                                                    | -           | Typing 'dd' with the same finger.                           |
| **dSFB**          | **Disjointed Same Finger Bigram** | Pressing two keys with the same finger, separated by x letters, disrupting typing flow and increasing errors.                               | -           | Typing 'r' and 't' with the index finger, separated by 'e'. |
| **SFS**           | **Same Finger Skipgram**          | Synonym for Disjointed Same Finger Bigram (dSFB), indicating two keys pressed with the same finger but separated by one or more other keys. | -           | Typing 'r' and 't' with the index finger, separated by 'e'. |
| **LSB**           | **Lateral Stretch Bigram**        | A bigram where the hand must stretch laterally, causing discomfort and slowing typing speed.                                                | -           | Typing 'v' after 'b' on a standard QWERTY keyboard layout.  |
| **Redirect**      | **Redirection**                   | A one-handed sequence of at least three letters that changes direction, disrupting typing flow and slowing speed.                           | -           | Typing 'sfd' on a keyboard layout.                          |
